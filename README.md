GITHUB_USER = "your_username"
REPO_NAME = "your_repository"
BRANCH = "main"  # or "master" if that's your default branch
```

2. Place both `repo-updater.py` and `run.bat` inside the folder containing the files you want to update.

3. Run the file by double-clicking `run.bat` or by opening terminal and running
